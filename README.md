# GUSI68

GUSI (Grand Unified Socket Interface) is a POSIX/Pthreads/Sockets library bringing some of the comforts of UNIX 98 to classic MacOS (7.0+). GUSI68 is a fork that lets it be used with Retro68.

Currently does not build, but the CodeWarrior files (which are currently kept in original_nw) are fully converted to sane .cpp/.h files.
