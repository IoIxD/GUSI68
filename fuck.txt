CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 3.5 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.


CMake Warning (dev) at /opt/Retro68-Source/cmake/retro68.toolchain.cmake.in:21 (set):
  Policy CMP0053 is not set: Simplify variable reference and escape sequence
  evaluation.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0053" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  For input:

    '@RETRO68_ROOT@'

  the old evaluation rules produce:

    '/opt/Retro68/toolchain/'

  but the new evaluation rules produce:

    '@RETRO68_ROOT@'

  Using the old result for compatibility since the policy is not set.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  /usr/share/cmake/Modules/CMakeDetermineSystem.cmake:148 (include)
  CMakeLists.txt:3 (project)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
